# nativeTodoAPP

The code for the TODO app is found in the todo.js file.
The methods file was practicing fetching data from Reddit.

A  simple react native TODO App with HTTP methods

I used the json-server with db.json as the database. It was my first time using the mock database. I found
it useful for quick testing of pulling in API data and practicing the HTTP methods.
